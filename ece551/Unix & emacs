###Usage of UNIX
The format of command prompt:
**current_username@hostname:~$**: ~ means your home dictionary and $ means end
symbol and indicate to enter command

Some commands:
* **whoami**: command to show the current_username
* **man -S3 printf**: _man_ means the manual pages, _-S3_ is "optional" indicates
that we want materials related with _printf_ in section 3, it will search from
the beginning without _S3_
* **man man**: shows the table of manual
* **man -k compare**: shows everything related with _compare_


#####Dictionary
**absolute path**: specifies all of the dictionaries that must be traversed, starting
at the **root** which is called **/**.
eg. /home/drew/myfile.txt
**current working dictionary**: a relative path starts from the current

* **pwd**: printf the current working path
* **ls -l/-a**: _-l_ print extra information about each file; _-a_ requests list
all files including files whose name begin with a dot
* **mkdir/rmdir arg**: creates/removes(the dictionary must be empty) a dictionary
by the specifies name


#####Files
* **cat**: read one or more files, concatenates them together and prints them out
* **more**: displays one screenfull and then wait until you press a key before displaying
the next screenfull
* **less**: scroll up and down with the arrow keys, and search for text
* **head/tail**: shows just the start or the end of a file
* **mv/cp n_args**: the first n-1 are sources and the last one is destination
* **rm args**: delete files, and recursively delete all files and dictionary contained
within a dictionary by giving _-r_ option

#####Pattern Expansion: Globbing and Braces
_globbing_: patterns that expand to multiple arguments based on the files name in the current dictionary
  + *: _rm *~_ the pattern *~ matches any file name in the current dictionary whose name ends with ~.
  + ?: matches any one character
  + [...] or [!...]: _file0[123].txt_ will match _file01.txt file02.txt file03.txt_
  + if you want to use one of the special characters literally. For example, use * to mean character *,
  you use _escape_ character to remove its special meaning. _rm \*_ will remove exactly the file named *,
  while _rm *_ will remove all files.

_brace expansion_: take a list of comma-separated choices in curly braces, and replace the surround
argument with one version for each item in the list
  + file{abc, xyz, 123}.txt $\Rightarrow$ fileabc.txt, filexyz.txt, file123.txt
  + {a, b}{1, 2, 3} $\Rightarrow$ {a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3}
  + apply to remote computer, since we may do not want to expand based on local file name

#####Redirection and Pipes
When we run program under UNIX, we have access to _stdin, stdout, stderr_ by default.
- stdin: read for input from typing at the terminal
- stdout: write output to the terminal except error
-stderr: write error-related output to the terminal

**_Redirecting_** the input or output means that instead of the program reading from/writing to the terminal,
it will read/write the file you request.
+ "<" for input and ">" for output: ./program < file1.txt > output.txt
+ ">>" redirect the output to a file, but append to the original contents instead of erasing it.
+"here document" <<: _commend << EOF_ you could type multiple lines as input and end up with other EOF

**_pipes_**: A pipe connects the output of one program to the input of another program
_diff x.c y.c | less_: runs _diff x.c y.c_ which prints the different between the two files and then pass it as
the input to _less_ which allows you to scroll it. The two process run at the same time. It is also ok when there
are multiple inputs.

#####Search
- _grep_: _grep myFunction *.c_ search all files ending with _.c_ for _myFunction_
- _find_: _find . -name "pattern" -print_

#####Commend Shell
```bash
#!/full_path/bash         # # is comment(read as "pound" or "hash")
                          #! read as "bang"
for i in `find . -name \*.c`  #find all .c files in curr and sub dict
  do                          #replace the `` expression with the output
    echo "Current file is $i"   #add $ before variable
  done

for file in *_*  #find all files with _ in name
  do
    mv $file `echo $file | tr _ -` #replace _ with -
  done
```

#####Environment Variables
- _PATH_: specify where the shell should look for programs to execute
- _IFS_: control how the shell divides input up into fields. (IFS=$' ')

**Note**
- Most variables are local to the shell and will not be passed down to programs.
You could _export_: _export myVar = "hi"_
- _getenv_: to read environment variable. Take the name and return the value.
You can also declare main to take a third argument _char ** envp_ which is a
pointer to an array of strings containing the environment variable.


#####Remote Login: ssh
* Remote computer: type **ssh username@servername**, if the username is the same on both
systems, you can omit the _username@_ part
* Copy: user _smith_ copys a local file called _myFile_ into a directory called
_myDir_ on a remote server called _myserver.edu_:  _**scp** myFile smith@myserver.edu:myDir/_


###Debugger: GDB
To compile the code with debugging symbols:
- _-g_ to GCC: require that it include this debugging information
- _-ggdb3_: request the maximum amount of information in a GDB-special format. If
you compile program in multiple steps, you should include _-ggdb3_ at all steps.
- _M-x gdb_(ECS x or ALT-x, then type gdb): run gdb in Emacs

**start**: begin the program's execution. Stop the program as soon as execution
enters main.
**run**: run until encounter some other condition that causes it to stop.
**step(abbreviated s)**: execute until the execution arrow moves to a different line. Step will
go into a function called by the current line.
**next(abbreviated n)**: advance the program one line of code. Execute the entire called function
without stopping.
**print(abbreviated p)**: take an expression as an argument, evaluate that expression
and print the results.
- Note that the side-effects of expression will affect the state of program.
- Add _/x_ after _print_ to get the result in hexadecimal format.
- Add _@number_ after an lvalue, GDB will print number values starting at the location you named.

**display(abbreviated dis)**: take an expression as an argument and display its value every time GDB
stops and displays a prompt.
**backtrace**: list all frames.
**info**: use _help info_ to see various info command
- _info frame_: describe the memory layout of the current frame;
- _info types_: describe the types in the current frame.

**C-x C-a C-b**: set a breakpoint at the point, maybe with a condition
  - make a breakpoint on line for the condition _i==25_: (gdb) break 7 if i==25
  - make a breakpoint 1 be conditional: cond 1 i==25. If we write a _cond_ without
  condition, it makes a breakpoint unconditional.
  - we can also _enable_, _disable_ or _delete_ breakpoints by their numeric id
  - _info breakpoints_ to see the status of current breakpoints

**until**: cause a loop to execute until it finished
**finish(fin)**: finish the current function -_i.e._
**watch i**: cause GDB to stop whenever the value of i changes, and it will print
both the old and new value. If the scope of a certain value _p_ ends before it changes,
we could first use _print p_ to give it in a GDB variable(e.g., $6), and then _watch $6).

**Signal**: a notification from the OS in response to certain kinds of event which lets
GDB stop the program and give you control
- _SIGSEGV_: indicates a segmentation fault;
- _SIGABRT_: when your program calls _abort()_ or fail an _assert_;
- _SIGINT_: when the program interrupted. Use C-c(C-c C-c in emacs).
