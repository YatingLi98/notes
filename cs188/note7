###Decision Networks
**Chance Nodes**: (ovals) Each outcome in a chance node has an associated
probability, which can be determined by running inference on the underlying
Bayes' net it belongs to.
**Action Nodes**: (rectangles) Represent a choice between any of a number of
actions which we have the power to choose from.
**Utility Nodes**: (diamonds) Output a utility based on the values taken on by
their parents.

**Goal**: Select the action which yields the **maximum expected utility (MEU)**

The expected utility of taking an action a given evidence $e$ and $n$ chance nodes:
$$EU(a|e) = \sum _{x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}} P(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}|e)U(a, x_{1}, \dots, x_{n})$$
where $x_{i}$ represents a value that the $i_{th}$ chance node can take on.
$$MEU(e) = \max _{a} EU(a|e)$$

####The Value of Perfect Information (VPI)
$$MEU(e, E^{\prime}) = \sum _{e^{\prime}} P(e^{\prime}|e) MEU(e, e^{\prime})$$
$$\boxed {VPI(E^{\prime}, e) = MEU(e, E^{\prime}) - MEU(e)}$$

#####Properties of VPI
- **Nonnegativity**: $\forall E^{\prime}, e \quad VPI(E^{\prime}, e) \geq 0$
- **Nonadditivity**: $VPI(E_{j}, E_{k}|e) \neq VPI(E_{j}|e) + VPI(E_{k}|e)
\text{ in general}$
- **Order-independence**
